# MapUI_assignment

Acheiving this intersection between the line having (start,end) coordinates of a plane and between a very long linestring coordinates can be done by two ways 

1. Turf Function:
    where i have using the mapping through api of /turf/turf to get and calculate the intersection through using the turf.lineIntersect function

    : The time complexity analysis for calculating line intersections using the turf.lineIntersect function in the @turf/turf library can be broken down as follows:

    : Parsing LineString Inputs: The time complexity for parsing the input LineString coordinates is linear, O(n), where n is the number of coordinates in the LineString.

    : Building Spatial Index: The turf.lineIntersect function does not explicitly build a spatial index for line segments. Instead, it iterates over each line segment of the LineString and performs a pairwise intersection check. Therefore, there is no additional time complexity introduced by building a spatial index.

    : Pairwise Intersection Check: For each line segment in the LineString, the turf.lineIntersect function performs an intersection check with every other line segment. If there are k line segments in the LineString, this pairwise intersection check will result in a time complexity of O(k^2).

    Overall, the time complexity for calculating line intersections using the turf.lineIntersect function with a 5k long LineString will be approximately O((5k)^2) = O(25,000,000). This means that the time required for the computation will increase quadratically with the number of line segments in the LineString.


2. RTree2d:
    where i have using the mapping through a commonjs module of RTree2d of 2d to calculate the intersection of above
   
   : The time complexity analysis for calculating line intersections using the rtree2d library with a 5k long LineString can be summarized as follows:

   :  Building the R-tree: The time complexity for building the R-tree index depends on the specific implementation used by the rtree2d library. In general, building an : : : R-tree has a complexity of O(n log n), where n is the number of elements (line segments) being inserted into the tree.

    : Inserting Line Segments: Inserting each line segment into the R-tree has a complexity of O(log n), where n is the number of elements already present in the tree. Since : you have a LineString with 5k line segments, the overall time complexity for inserting all line segments would be O(5k log n).

    : Searching for Intersections: For each line segment in the LineString, you would need to search the R-tree for potential intersecting line segments. The search operation typically has a complexity of O(m + k), where m is the number of entries in the R-tree that overlap with the bounding box of the line segment, and k is the number of intersecting line segments found. The exact values of m and k depend on the specific characteristics of your data.

    Overall, the time complexity for calculating line intersections using the rtree2d library with a 5k long LineString can be approximated as O((5k log n) * (m + k)). It's important to note that the actual performance may vary depending on the specific implementation of the rtree2d library and the characteristics of the LineString data.
